    <p style="font-size: 110%"><em>My name is <i>Yerassyl</i>. My surname is Amanzhol. I am 18. I was born in 2002 in Finland. I live in a small town Aktau. My address is 14 microdistrict, 37 house. My phone number is 7292-32-2-45. I am a student. I
        go to <span style="color: brown; font-weight: bold">Astana IT University</span>. I am a good student. I do well in all subjects. They say that I am a hard-working person. To tell the truth, all university subjects come easy to me but
        sometimes I have to work long hours, for example, to do
        lessons
        in
        Calculus or Math, to solve problems or to learn a new topic by heart. But my favourite subject is Web-technology. I spend a lot of time on it reading books, doing tests etc. Maybe Web technologies and learning it will be a part of my future
        carreer. I like construct the sites. I think comics and detective stories are much easier to read but I prefer to read novels - historical or modern. I like music. My musical tastes are different, it depends on my mood. But I think every
        apple
        is good in its season. I play the piano and the guitar, not seriously but for my soul. Sometimes I like to listen to Russian classical music. My favourite composers are Chaikovsky and Mozart. I also like English folk songs but I don't like
        rock
        music. I don't have much time to watch TV but sometimes I spend an hour or two watching an interesting film or a news programme. In the evening I often read newspapers (our local ones) or BBC. I like fresh air and exercise. I wish I had more
        time for doing sports. But some aerobics in the morning, a swimming pool twice a week, a ski-walk on a frosty day are of great help. Sport is fun. I have a wide circle of interests. I'm very sociable, so I get on very well with people. I have
        many friends, most of them are my classmates. We spend a lot of time together going out to the cinema or to a disco party, speaking about lessons and music, discussing our problems. But most of all I like my family. We all are great friends
        and
        deeply attached to each other. That's all about me - a person with his good and not very good traits of character, liking this and hating that. But it's interesting for me to live and to open new things.</em></p>

    <h2>Little information about my town</h2>

      <img id="aktau" src="aktau.webp" alt="aktaupic">
      <strong>Aktau</strong> (Kazakh: Aqtaý; Cyrillic: Ақтау) is a city in Kazakhstan, located on the Eastern shore of the Caspian Sea. Its current name means "white mountain" in Kazakh, which may be due to its cliffs that overlook the Caspian. From
      1964 to 1991, the city was known as Shevchenko (Russian: Шевченко). Its former name was given due to the eponymous Ukrainian poet's period of exile in the area. It is located on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and is the capital of the Mangystau
      Region. Aktau is known for its unique block address system. Almost no streets in Aktau have names; instead, addresses generally consist of three numbers: the district number (also known as micro-region/micro-district/block), the building
      number, and the apartment number. This is because Aktau was originally planned as a camp for the workers of the oil industry. Aktau was once the site of a nuclear power station. The BN-350 FBR went online in 1973, and was shut down in 1999. The
      long-term plans of the Government of Kazakhstan include the construction of a new nuclear power station to be built near the site. In addition to producing plutonium, BN-350 was used to provide power and for desalination to supply fresh water
      to the city. The current station is not considered powerful enough to supply the fresh water and energy needed at this time, and blackouts are a common occurrence.
